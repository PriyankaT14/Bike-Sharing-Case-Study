# Bike-Sharing-Case-Study

## Problem Statement

To build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

A bike-sharing provider Boom Bikes provides a bike sharing system in which bikes are made available for sharing to individuals on a short-term basis for a price or free. Recently Boom Bikes has suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to ongoing Corona pandemic situation and finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end. Boom Bikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all-around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

The company wants to know:

•	Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes?

•	How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Business Goal:

•	Develop a model to find the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.

•	It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features, they can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectation.

•	The model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Steps:

•	Data Preparation

•	Model Building

•	Model Evaluation
